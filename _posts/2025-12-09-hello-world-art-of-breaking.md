## Welcome

My name is **Fried**, though in the CTF trenches, I go by **Vivisect0r**. I am currently a university fresher with a singular focus: offensive security and penetration testing.

This website is my digital notebook. It’s where I will document my journey into the world of cybersecurity. You will find CTF writeups (TryHackMe/HackTheBox), explorations of web vulnerabilities, and my attempts to understand how systems work by taking them apart.

### Why "Vivisect0r"?
Because to truly understand a living network, you have to examine its internal structures, find the weak points, and see what makes it tick.

## The Sound of Perseverance

You might be wondering about the imagery on this blog.

When I'm not staring at a terminal or debugging Python scripts, my escape is anime. My absolute favorite is **Your Lie in April** (*Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso*).

_The vibrant world of Your Lie in April._

Cybersecurity can feel very technical and binary—zeros and ones, success or failure. But like music, true mastery requires creativity, intuition, and an almost obsessive level of practice.

**Kousei Arima’s** journey to face his trauma and play the piano again resonates with me. Learning security is frustrating. You hit walls constantly. You feel like you aren't good enough.

_The discipline required to master a craft._

This anime reminds me that dedication pays off, and that even technical skills can be performed with art and passion.

I hope you’ll follow along as I learn the "music" of cybersecurity.
